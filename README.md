# Studio Ghibli Films App

## What the app does
This iOS app is a simple **Studio Ghibli film guide** built with **SwiftUI**.

- Detailed view for each film (title, original titles, synopsis, director, producer, year, runtime, Rotten Tomatoes score)
- User feedback for loading states (`ProgressView`)
- Robust error handling for API/network failures (no crashes, friendly retry option)
- Clean, styled UI with gradients and card-like containers
